## 📖 About This Project

This was the **very first project** I ever created when I started learning how to code—specifically using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
I don’t remember the exact date I built it, but I traced it back to a [Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57940061/css-is-not-working-in-the-server-but-its-working-well-in-the-local-machine) I posted on **September 14, 2019 at 23:39**, which gives a clue about the time I was working on it.

At that time, I was completely new to web development. I faced a common beginner issue: _“CSS working locally but not on the server.”_  
To get help, I copy-pasted part of this project to CodePen and asked the Stack Overflow community for guidance.

Later, I managed to **recover** the lost parts of this project—some from CodePen, others from random GitHub repos where I had sourced images and CSS files.  
Now, it’s back together, and it feels amazing to look at it again.

## 🧠 Why "Goose Bumps"?

I named it "Goose Bumps" because of the **nostalgic value** it holds for me. Revisiting this old piece of code gives me a rush—reminding me how far I've come since that uncertain but exciting beginning.

> “Such a great nostalgia.”

This isn’t just a project. It’s a piece of my coding origin story.

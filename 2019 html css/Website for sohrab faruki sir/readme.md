## 📖 About This Project

This project holds a very special place in my journey as a developer. It was the **first website I built entirely by myself**—without following a step-by-step tutorial like I did with OmniFood.

At the time, I was in my **third year**, and I wanted to create something meaningful. I decided to build a website dedicated to **Sohrab Faruki Sir**—one of my very favorite teachers.  
I admired him deeply for his **honesty**, **clarity**, and **dedication**, and this website was my small tribute to him.
